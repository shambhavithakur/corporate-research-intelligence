# Deployment Configuration

This directory contains deployment configurations for the Corporate Research Intelligence platform.

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shambhavithakur/corporate-research-intelligence.git
cd corporate-research-intelligence

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your actual API keys to .env

# Run demonstration
python src/research_engine/main.py
```

### Google Cloud Platform

- Support for scheduled research reports

#### BigQuery Integration
- Data warehousing for historical research analysis
- SQL-based querying for complex market intelligence
- Integration with Google Data Studio for executive dashboards
- Automated data pipeline for continuous intelligence updates

### AWS Deployment

#### Lambda Functions
- Event-driven research automation
- Cost-effective for periodic research tasks
- Integration with S3 for data storage
- CloudWatch monitoring for system health

#### EC2 Instances
- Full control over research environment
- Suitable for continuous monitoring systems
- Custom security configurations
- Direct database connectivity

### Docker Containerization

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY src/ ./src/
COPY .env.example .env

CMD ["python", "src/research_engine/main.py"]
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API access for AI analysis
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Business contact information
- `MAX_RESEARCH_SOURCES`: Data source limitations
- `REPORT_CACHE_HOURS`: Research report caching duration

### Optional Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for data persistence
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: GCP project ID for cloud services
- `NEWS_API_KEY`: News data source integration

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Store API keys in secure environment variables
- Use cloud secret management services (Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate API keys regularly following security best practices
- Never commit API keys to version control

### Data Protection
- Implement proper access controls for research data
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Encrypt sensitive research findings at rest
- Comply with data retention and privacy policies

## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Request/response logging for API endpoints
- Performance metrics for research analysis speed
- Error tracking and alerting for system failures
- Usage analytics for business intelligence insights

### Business Metrics
- Research request volume and patterns
- Client satisfaction and report accuracy tracking
- Cost optimization and resource utilization
- ROI measurement for automated research systems

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Load balancing for high-volume research requests
- Database read replicas for improved performance
- CDN integration for faster report delivery

### Vertical Scaling
- Memory optimization for large dataset processing
- CPU scaling for intensive AI analysis workloads
- Storage scaling for historical research data
- Network optimization for real-time data collection
